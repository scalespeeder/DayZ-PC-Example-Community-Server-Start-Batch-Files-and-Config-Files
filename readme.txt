This is a simple collection of serferDZ.cfg & .bat start files that I use to start and configure my local DayZ PC Server, and may be of use as examples for your servers.

Please note that you'll have to change file addresses to suit your instalation, and have the relevant mods & missions installed.

Thanks, Rob.
